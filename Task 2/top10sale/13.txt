I love this hair dryer! It has more settings than I am used to. I love the adapter pieces. I styled it with the styling tip and it looked like I got my hair done at the salon.
One of our daughters had this item on her &#34;wish list&#34;.  She was excited when she opened it.....very proud of her gift.  Appears to be quality and looks durable.
i like the color and it's worked great...love all the heat and power settings...so far with this blowdryer
I love love love this hair dryer. Its fast and powerful. Gets the job done within 10 minutes for me.
This is by far the best hair dryer I have purchased.. I have thick long hair (past my waist) and it dries my hair quickly. Lots of airflow.. for the amount of power I feel it has its a plus that its much smaller then the dryers I've had.. I wouldn't say it was quiet but its not very loud.. it kinda hums instead of the high pitch whistling others have..And im in love with beautiful color and texture.. I bought another as a Xmas gift for my mother-in-law I know she will love it... The 4 yr warranty is a very nice bonus!
It was really loud, unnecessarily powerful for drying hair, my daughter was petrified of it and then it suddenly glowed red and started smoking!
My wife bought this, but I'll leave my two cents. This is a very quiet hair dryer. I figured that was something interesting that you should know. The air blows smooth and has a cool air button. The weight is about average and comes with two end pieces that I have no idea what they are for. Its a very nice hair dryer. The quiet factor with our sleeping baby is something I didn't expect.
This is a great hair dryer!! It's cooler than most, which is what gives hair its shine and control. Works very well.
Great high quality hair dryer that works extremely well. Comes with a diffuser and all so it is great for even long, thick curly hair. Dries it quickly and overall it even looks like a very nice product as the handle material is very smooth wit grip. Great value for purchase, would highly recommend.
I LOVE this hair dryer.  I have medium-long but thick hair, and my hair dries in literally 1/3 to 1/2 the time of my old hair dryer.  Comes with the two separate attachments (directional and diffuser) and then both work great and attach firmly but easily.  Great product!
Does exactly what i need to do. Perfect! It has a nice texture and nice shape. not too heavy or too light.
Excellent buy...this was for my sister and he is in love with it. The product arrived on time and in perfect conditions.
It is a v dryer, my girlfriend loved it! Arrived safely in its box with all parts! I highly recommend it!
Magic. Pure magic. Attachments are hard to get off, but I don't want them falling on my feet when I'm drying my hair either. Heat settings in addition to fan speed adjustment are awesome. Cute color and feels great in my hand. Dries my thick mane super quickly!
I have had this dryer for 3+ years and it's still going strong. I love the &#34;satin&#34; feel of the dryer, the 3 settings (plus the &#34;cool jet&#34; button), and the diffuser and concentrator are perfect. This dryer has been through the ringer- from airports to duffle bags to being dropped, etc- and it still works like the day I bought it. Super easy to clean out the dust in the filter too, the back just screws off. Would buy again.
This is my absolute favorite hair dryer ever. It dries my hair very fast since it's ceramic. I love the styling options and my hair gets a lot of volume.
My wife purchased this hair dryer after reading so many positive reviews.  It's still going strong a year later, but she complains her fingers get in the way of the buttons on the handle, turning the hair dryer off while she is trying to dry her hair.
This machine is amazing! Works like a charm. I have long, thick hair (down my back). This thing dries my hair in 3 minutes -- I have timed it. It used to take me over 10 minutes to dry my hair with a standard dryer. Sturdy design, and the light pink buttons add a nice touch too.
certainly powerful, and excellent value for money, other that the cord being a bit short, I'm very satisfied with it
This hair dryer dries my fine straight hair very quickly and is rather quiet for a hair dryer. It's a little on the heavy side, so if you have hair that takes a long time to dry, you might want to get a lighter dryer so your arm doesn't get tired.
it is better than what i expect and gives me more than i want. this hair dryer has three shifts which are perfect for me. it also can swithch to the cold model. loves it. highly recommend
THIS HAIR DRYER IS EXTREMELY HEAVY. IT IT ALSO VERY HOT AND PLEASE BE CAREFUL IF YOU DRY YOUR HAIR ON HIGH.  I HAVE ACTUALLY SAW MY HAIR SPARK WHEN DRYING. SO PLEASE USE CAUTION.
My customers  and my family love it so I love,  I will continue to promote it the best way I can .
I have thick and course hair.  I think this dryer does a great job, especially for the price.  It is heavy as the other reviews state.  I was using a travel hair dryer prior to this, so the weight definitely took some getting used to.  It drys my hair about as quickly as any dryer can.  I would recommend this product.
Love this! It's stronger than most blow dryers I've used in the past 3 years. The look is very professional and the color is a deep purple with soft pink. I should have purchased the hair wand that went with it. Matchy Matchy!
I'm giving this hair dryer 4 stars because I haven't had it or used it long enough to see if there are long term issues. It dries my hair quickly. It is a bit heavy, though.<br /><br />Edit: My hair gets caught in the air intake... it hurts!
Drying my hair has never required much time since I live in an arid climate, yet this dryer seems to dry my hair more quickly & to increase the volume.  Very pleased with this product.
My husband insisted I search for a new, QUIET hairdryer and I chose this one based on all of the reviews. In comparison to the last few hairdryers I have had it is incredibly quiet and it is also very powerful. I have very thick hair that usually takes around 20 minutes to get dry and this has done it in half the time. Highly recommend it!
Exceeded my expectations while it worked.  I read the reviews about the hair dryer suddenly dying, but gambled that it wouldn't happen to me.  Wrong.  Turned it on this morning and nothing happened.  Completely dead.  I will contact Remington but don't expect the problem will be remedied.<br /><br />Oh well, the search continues.
I returned it, no questions asked. Not only was it too heavy for me, it also blew too hot for me on low.
Everything was great for about 6 month, the it stop working, why they keep selling a product that only last 6 months?, Better to take them from the market entirely and replace it with on that works longer even id it is more expensive.  One thing is certain, I will not buy a Remington drier ever!!
OK for the price.. nothing special. I wish I would have chose something else.. take too long to dry my hair
So I purchased this hair dryer in March 2013 and I need a new one already.  While it worked it  but then things went wrong as I dry my hair I see a spark like when you pull a plug out of the wall.  I don't know if it is because I use a metal brush but it snaps and then sparks not so great.
V buy is what I was looking for gifts, it is in v condition and I have no complaints, thanks.
I don't like that high pitched whine that comes from some blow dryers. I had to rely on reviews here to feel comfortable enough to make this purchase, so I am returning the favor.<br /><br />This blow dryer is sturdy, substantial and quieter than any dryer I have owned previously. The price was reasonable and the shipping prompt. Note it doesn't fold for travel, but that wasn't a factor for me.
Seems slow to blow. Works okay otherwise. Not a lot of power compared to my much less expensive dryer that lasted 6 years. I should have replaced it with the same one but went with reviews I saw on Amazon about this dryer. Live and learn.
I researched a lot of hair dryers before finally deciding on this one. My priorities for a dryer is to not be too loud, and to dry my hair fast. I have thick long hair, and it can take 10-15 mins to get my hair completely dried. My old Conair dryer was working ok, but it was very loud and was taking a lot time to dry. Aesthetically, this dryer is very cute. It is quite large, but I love the texture and the pink accents. Some people had said it was a bit heavy, it is heavier than my Conair, but not too much where I feel like I have trouble holding it. It comes with 2 attachments, a diffuser and a concentrated air nozzle. I use the concentrated air nozzle every day. It is easy to attach and easy to come off. The best thing about this dryer is that it is not very loud at all! And yes, it does dry my hair a LOT quicker. With the help of the concentrated nozzle and a round brush, I can get my hair dry within 5-10 minutes. This is a huge improvement. It comes in 3 settings with 3 levels of heat, as well as a cold air button. The back of the dryer is easy to twist off for you to clean. Overall, I am very pleased with this dryer. Remington also has a 4 year warranty, which is very comforting.
I've used it only a couple times, i like it. It gets the job done. Had no problems with packaging or delivery, it arrived fast :)
I'm not that impressed. I didn't notice a difference in the time it took to dry my hair. And it's heavier than my old dryer. However I did notice that my hair does look smoother.
I bought this hair dryer about four years ago and it's been great. I'm really fussy about the air flow, most dryers don't seem to push enough air through to satisfy me, but this one is perfect. It drys quickly, and the heat settings are perfect. The only problem I've faced is about 6 months ago the product starts to make high pitched screaming/squealing noises, and they are LOUD. I like to dry my hair upside down, and I can't anymore because the dryer is especially noisy (I believe the fan unit has come lose and shakes around in the barrel which leads to the screeching). Besides that, it's lasted a long time, and it's a great product at a price you can't beat. After 4 years my current one is probably unsafe to use, so I am ordering my second one soon.
don't waist your time or money on this one.<br /><br />This POS is only used for an hour every other week.  My $10.00 Braun one lasted 7 years
I got this blow dryer on Christmas of 2011. Afte year and two months of use it started making a shrill sound and started squeaking. I ignored it thinking maybe something was what could I do about it? But then after that in the 3rd month of year two (15 months) I started sparking the coils turned bright red and literally shot fire through it at my head. This brand is supposedl brand but I disagree. A blow-dryer should last longer than 15 months. Especially one that was used maybe a total of one week a month. I would steer clear here if you don't want to light your hair on fire
This is a standard hairdryer. I can not say, as some have, that it made my hair look any shiner. It does dry my hair just as quickly as any other blow dryer.... no faster, no slower. The different heat settings are varied. Hot is really hot, so I just use the medium heat setting. I have only had it for a month, so I can not comment on its durability. I would recommend it, but, it is a hairdryer, I can not say it will make your hair look any nicer than any other hairdryer.
I like this hair dryer but the hot setting on it is beyond hot, it's brain boiling!  Use with extreme caution!
This blow dryer throws a lot of air, however the air is not necessarily hot enough to dry your hair fast or smooth. Takes a long time to dry my hair and it does it a little frizzy compared to my previous blower which I had to throw Away because the cable began to get hot. But it' blower for the price I paid!
Excellent performance and quality--heavier than many other dryers, but with a solid feel and excellent fan performance.  I like it more than other dryers I have used.
I like it so much, I bought two, for two separate bathroom. It for the price you pay.
I wanted a hairdryer with decent power/air output, that was fairly quiet, at a decent (consumer) price. I was tired of other weak hairdryers that didn't have enough air output, and found this one had the power to dry my thick hair. The finish is a nice rubberized maroon color that loo too! It's pretty easy to hold, smaller in size and weight, and has a long cord. The lint screen on the back is easy to access too, which is often what causes a hairdryer to lose its air flow, so that's super handy.  I actually purchased a second one of these online (the first one broke, my fault, after I slammed it on the counter oops :S) after Wal-Mart stopped carrying them so I'm a happy customer reviewer (and I'm pretty picky)
Kept looking at different ones and finally decided on this one. I have hair I blow straight everyday so I need something that will last and so far no complaints on this one. Good output and a nice weight.
After about two weeks of purchasing, air leaks from the handle, the switch, and the back of the dryer. I concerned there will be electricity leakage, who knows when.Today I want to return it, but it says the return is only allowed within 30 days. I was too busy to request the return when I first found the problem. The product is of poor quality and dangerous to use, plus the short time warranty. I will never buy it!!!
This is the only dryer I use. I love the force and power it has. If you want volume this is the way to go
I bought this to replace another Remington that I'd used for a few years.  So far, I've been really happy with my purchase.  I chose this because of the quality of Remingtons I've had in the past, and this one seems to be just the same as the others.  Quality.  The blow dryer does have a slight rubbery feel.  I've never had one like that.  Can't say I care; it's just different.  Not better or worse.<br /><br />I did choose this one specifically because of the attached diffuser.  Essential for those of us with curly hair, and it works well.
I have never owned an professional hairdryer. Mine are usually fairly cheap (under $25). That  being said, this is the best I have seen in it's price range. The attachments fit without being whipped across the room for no reason like my others and it dries hair twice as fast as my previous. I don't have as many split ends either. For durability it has held up fairly well being used at least once daily by a complete klutz who drops things. Never any damage, cracking, or peeling. It is also quite pretty! Some say it is heavy in the reviews. While I was used to a lighter one, I only noticed a weight difference the first few times before it seemed normal to me. The only issue I have had with it is that my long hair will sometimes get sucked in the back. I have learned to keep it held higher. And since it is slightly heavier than my last I guess I get a light work out while doing so, lol. Overall a v hair dryer and I would recommend.
I upgraded to this dryer from my basic Conair dryer and thought I would get someth based on the reviews, but really, it was a waste of money to simply buy another blow dryer. It doesn't do anything better than previous ones I've owned, and in fact, seems to make my hair slightly MORE frizzy. Plus, the buttons are placed right where your fingers wrap around, so I had to train myself to hold it differently as the first few weeks I kept switching the buttons in the middle of drying. I've seen other complaints about the motor shorting out, and so far, I haven't had any issues like that, just not really impressed with how it dries my hair. And no way is it really quiet. Pfffft.
The dryer does its job well and despite its large size is fairly easy to handle.  Speaking of the handle, it stays cool, as does the rest of the casing.  It is a bit noisier than I thought it would be but it has a deeper sound than our previous dryer... which kind of whined.
I love this dryer. My old remington was amazing so i knew i wanted to stick w/ the same brand. Its amazing. Works great and the color is the best part. plus it feels like velvet!!
found it to feel heavy,and the buttons change speed and temp easily while drying hair .Does dry hair quickly is i feature
I Like the dryer. Good quality, but heavy. Can recommend the product. Was delivered faster then expected. USPS delivry guy did not ring the bell. Just drop the dryer next the door
My daughter in law recommended this blow dryer, so I purchased it.  It dries my hair in half the time than my other blow dryer.  It's light weight and easy to use, yet powerful!
A bit on the heavy side but very well made.  Wide range of heat and blower settings.  Works great!  When was the last time that you bought an electrical appliance for under $30 that had a FOUR YEAR WARRANTY???
This hair dryer sucks my hair into the back end and pulls hair right out of my head. I've had very long, very curly hair for 20 years and have used many hair dryers, and that has never happened before. I don't know how other dryers prevent this from happening, but they forgot to add that feature to this design. I've used it twice and am returning it.
I have really long hair so I go through blow dryers like there is no tomorrow!  This one so far has lasted over 6months for me which I think is great!!  It does have a funny way of turning it on, but once you figure that out you  to go!
I like that this hair drier is quiet. It has multiple heat settiing wit high heat setting.  It is comfortable fit for my hand and not heavy which makes blow drying less toil some. Although not heavy it does not lack in quality and durability.  I have owned several dryers and refused to setlle for a poor quality. This is superior in quality performance and durability compared to the typical Conair brands.I have owned for several months now and have no complaints and works as well as the day I purchased  If looking for quite and quality I would recommend Remington.  Well worth it.
I have only used the diffuser and low speed setting for this but I love that it sends only cool air so I get the right type of drying power. I have been using this every other day for a couple weeks and I haven't noticed any damage to my hair. It is also consistently the same temperature so I don't get a mix of warm / cold air. The cold blast button I think still works but I'll have to read the instructions again on whether you hold it down or just push the button. If it's that you just push the button, I don't notice it getting any cooler after depressing it. Other than the mysterious button, this has been great. It's easy to hold and doesn't slip in my hands at all. The cord doesn't wrap itself up while I'm using it, which was an issue with my last blowdryer. It was constantly coiling up when I lifted it. I do not wrap the cord around the body of my tools, so this was especially annoying. This is my first diffusing hairdryer, so I cannot compare it to anything else but I will say that when its last day comes, I am happy enough to buy the same product.
Fully trust in the brand and the model powerful
Love this hair dryer.  My hair is silky smooth using this.  The multiple heat settings are really  helpful and it dries my long fine hair very quickly.  Plus it is a great design.  Super happy!
The socket blow up and got alot of sparkles make me so scary throw it away and didnt use it again ever
for the price, this i product.  i have long, thick hair and it doesn't take very long to dry with this one.  my only complaint is that the diffuser is pretty small.  otherwise, it' dryer.
My hair is super thick and in the past when I used to blow dry it never came out soft and smooth like after the salon, it was always dry and frizzy. A beautician friend of mine recommended switching to a ceramic iononic conditioning hair dryer and recommended the brand Hot Tools. I had purchased a ridiculously over priced hot tools hair dryer and I figured you have to pay more for results. I no longer had dry frizzy hair after blow drying, it was silky, soft and smooth just like after the salon and I was overjoyed. Several weeks ago my hot tools hair drier broke. I couldn't afford to replace it so I looked for a cheaper alternative. I found this dryer for more than 50 dollars cheaper than the one I was trying to replace and it had very similar specifications, so I took a chance and I've never been happier. It does such a better job than the over priced professional hair dryer. My hair dries in nearly half the time. It's never been smoother or softer.<br /><br />The drier is much lighter than my old one and comfortably fits in my hand due to its ergonomic shape. It isn't very loud like most driers, instead of a high pitched whiny sound it's nice low whooshy sound. I always compared hair driers to sounding like a power drill... well this one doesn't sound like a power drill, it sounds like a device that blows air, like it should. The included attachments (concentrator and diffuser) are an added bonus. I've used the concentrator with great success and I haven't used the diffuser yet (since I recently cut my hair very short and only use a diffuser for my natural waves when my hair is long).<br /><br />For the price the blow dryer definitely exceeds expectations. I'm going to buy the other remington Tstudio styling tools just based on my experience with the dryer.
Bought this hair dryer for my wife to replace her old one that was starting to physically wear out. This one dried her hair several minutes faster than the old one (even with hair/dust cleaned out of the filter). Highly recommend, the finish is a soft touch / satiny plastic paint / coating that fe to hold in your hand.
After much heavy use by two people daily, my original Remington Ac2015 finally bit the dust.  It laste long time.  I loved it so much I ordered the same one as a replacement.  I didn't even see what else was out there, which I never do - I'm the research queen!  I figured why look for something else when this one has everything.  It's quiet, has perfect temperatures and it dries fast.  Leaves my hair silky and shiny. It is a bit heavier than some but you get used to it quickly.  Feels solid and has a nice no slip texture plus an extra long cord.  Highly recommended.
The dryer is stylish and works well but is on the heavy side and takes some getting used to. Overal purchase for the cost.
I did a search for &#34;quiet dryers&#34; and this came up.  The reviews sounded ok so I went for it.  It's considerably heavier than the old one I had and definitely stronger.  Overall, it feels like a solid build and does its job with the only complaint being that it's a bit heavier for some (perhaps).  I'd recommend it but have only been using it for 2 weeks.
I picked this hairdryer because of the high reviews on Amazon, and I was not disappointed.  My girlfriend loves this hairdryer.  It feels like a quality item when you hold it in your hands.
This is a nice blow dryer. It works well, is very solidly built (somewhat heavy for its size, but that doesn't bother me). It is comfortable to hold and just the right size (medium...not to small or big). The highest heat setting is too hot for me (which is a change from my previous blow dryer, but tells me it  heating elements), so I keep it on medium. For some reason, I thought it was black when I purchased it, but it is a very pretty dark plum color, with pink accents...very &#34;stylish&#34;! :) Oh, and I love the &#34;cool shot&#34; feature!
I have very thick, curly hair and the power in this dryer does the job in great time!  Thank you!
I love this hair dryer.  It fits well in my hand.  Drys my hair beautifully and quickly.  I have fine hair and this dryer is not &#34;too much&#34;.  It has several speeds and heat options.  Would definitely recommend.
The quality of ionized hair-drying you get with this dryer is no less than top of the line salon dryers like CHI. The build quality of this dryer is better than my CHI that died on me. When I opened the CHI to attempt to repair it, I couldn't believe how cheaply made it was and I was amazed at what the retail markup must be. It's like jewelry, they must be making a fortune...The only reason to buy a CHI over this dryer is if you are a stylist and you have an image to uphold, i.e. pretentious clientele that would look down on you for using a Remington.
Hardest blowing hair dryer for the price.  This is the second one we bought. Works great!  Can't go wrong. x
Very affordable hair dryer. Came in on time. Its a very powerful dryer.<br /><br />I recommend for everyday use.<br /><br />Cons: the color and its a bit heavy.
awesome! dries my hair faster than any other drier i have.. and my hair is thick! i would recommend this.
Having used numerous blow dryers in my business, I have to say this has been one of my favorites for so many reasons. It's lightweight and I can actually carry on a conversation with my clients without having to lower the speed...love the design! I highly recommend this product and would purchase again.
Very heavy and bulky.  Does dry pretty quickly, but really can't tell a big difference from previous dryer.  Not bad, but just okay.
Love how quiet this dryer is.  It fe in the hand however it is a bit on the heavy side.  You get used to it after using it for awhile.  Other than the weight issue it is an amazing dryer!
Great hairdryer the wife is very happy. I went with this one because it had many reviews and seemed popular
This blow dryer was great for the first year and a half (bought it brand new), but just recently it started to spark every time I used it. At first I thought it may have been a little glitch, but it's been sparking every time now. I have stopped using it so my hair and or face doesn't catch on fire! Scary!
, dryes my hair really fast and its cute too! I got 2 one for me and one for my friend she loves it as well!
This does exactly what I need it to, it's really quiet which is nice, but still does it's job. Quick drying process and I have notoriously hard to dry hair, so I'm please with this purchase. It doesn't get too hot like other dryers I haven't had any issues with burning myself by staying on one spot too long.
This product arived on time and is a very powerful dryer for the price, all the pieces are very sturdy as well, what I did not like was that in the picture the pieces looked white, which was my main reason for the purchase, but the pieces  obviously pink up close.
Love the multiple heat and speed settings.  After 3 months though, I have noticed that some air leak out from the base of the handle, where it meets the cord.  Maybe the plastic fitting became loose from hanging the hair dryer on a hook.
My old hair dryer died a rather spectacular death with sparks and smoke.  I hadn't researched hair dryers before, and I only wanted something that would dry my hair.  So I randomly picked a conair from a local store.  I used it a few times and was not happy with the results for the conair.  It turned out to be loud as all get out, and my hair turned out flat.  I felt like I was in a deafening windstorm.  So now I had a criteria for research:  Something that was quiet and didn't blow my hair into a limp state.  That's what lead me to this Remington.  It shipped and got here quickly.  Yes, it smelled a bit funny as all new hair appliances do when first used, but I was impressed.  It was easy to handle.  I liked that I didn't have to keep sliding buttons up and down to change settings like my old hair dryer.  It was relatively quiet as hair dryers go.  The drying process went very quickly.  My hair had plenty of volume with a smooth, soft feeling when all was said and done.  I'm very happy.  No flat hair and my ears aren't ringing.  I highly recommend the Remington hair dryer.
shonnila<br />Excellent Product at an Excellent Price! The first time I used it my husband said my hair looked like it had a salon finish.....Love it!
This hair dryer is amazing. It has the perfect temperatures and blow strength. For thick hair that takes long to dry, this is a miracle! And it's very sturdy, firm, robust. It seems that a made a v choice!
I'm very pleased with this purchase for the price.  The hairdryer is powerful and heats up quickly and the concentrator nozzle is just the right size for drying your hair with a barrel brush.  I also like the look and feel of it - the coating on the handle makes it easy to grip.  The only con is a very minor one (and why I rate this as 4 stars) is that it's a little heavier than previous hairdryers which I've owned but this wouldn't put me off purchasing this model again.
I like it very much, for hair drying, it works very well. The two accessories are not so often used anyway.
super sleek looking.<br />works great!<br />cold air gives out cold air n hot gives out hot. if you know what i mean. not like those hair dryers that give warm air when you want cold.<br /><b investment
This blowdryer is okay. I orignally bought it because i heard it was a reliable brand and I also needed a new blow dryer and this was on sale with a 4 dollar off coupon. The filter that the air goes in through and then gets heated and comes out the other end so the back side it my hair gets stuck in this everytime i use it! it drives me crazy! So everytime i have to stop the bblow dryer and cut my hair out of it and clean the filter! The smell also i a dirffernt smell that comes out i dont know if thats just because my hair that gets stuck is making it smell because it burned or that its just a differnt blow dryer from my preivou one but i think i might just have t get used to it.
I've been using the same blow dryer since high school, and recently it caught fire, so that was that. I spent a long time reading reviews and comparing prices trying to find a new blow dryer and I eventually decided on this one after I was able to go to Target and see it outside of the box in person. This dryer is really awesome, it drys my hair fast, doesn't seem to cause too much damage to my hair and I love the rubberized feel of it while holding it. It doesn't have a lot fancy options or anything, just your generic three heat levels, three blow settings, and a cool button. However, my friend is a hair stylist at a pretty fancy hair salon and when she stayed over one night and used it after showering the next morning, she came out of the bathroom to ask about the blow dryer. She asked how much I paid for it, and after telling her, she indicated that she couldn't believe how well it worked. She also complained that she had recently had to buy a new blow dryer for work and she couldn't see much of a difference between hers and mine expect about $100.
Very nice blow dryer. Bit of an odor the first uses, it needs to burn off before it will fade. Pretty and very happy with the number of speed and heat settings.
My Sister got one for Christmas and I borrowed it from her.....fell in love with it! My hair is thick and it dries in less time than my other one.
Do not buy. It was great while it lasted, but it shorted out after 3 months of use.<br />Quiet and Seemed to be quality...until its very early smoking, stinking death.<br /><br />Find another that lasts longer.
This hairdryer is everything I need, great choice for me. Would reccomend to anyone that does not need a professional type hair dryer
I love Remington products!  This hair dryer has performed perfectly for the $20 I got it for on Amazon.<br />I replaced my Conair Ion Shine after 7 years.  Regret not doing it sooner!<br />My hair was frizzing and I thought it was because of my age!  Nope - my Conair was shot!<br />So since the on/off switch broke on the Conair - I finally decided that was unsafe enough to warrant a new hair dryer.<br /> Plus I never like the switches on that dryer anyway.<br />I love this Tstudio hair dryer.  It is not too loud - which is great if you suffer from hearing or headache issues.<br />I love the color.  It is extremely attractive.  It is a dark chocolate brown with a pinky purple accent.  Goes nicely with my bathroom decor.  OH!  AND THE BEST PART!  It does not hurt my hands!  It is ergonomic!  I feels like a dream!  It is a perfect fit in my palm and I don't feel the switches are in the way at all.  I found that I naturally held the dryer so the thumb was grasping along the length of the switches which is perfect!  So excited about that part!<br />Was going to buy the BaBlyss (sp?) but when I checked that out on YouTube, I intensely disliked the noise of it.<br />So - Remington it is!  I hope that I get at least 3 or 4 years out of it and I will be an extremely happy customer.
My girl ONLY wanted this hair dryer to replace the same one that just died.  Found it here on Amazon FAR cheaper than anywhere else and with Amazon Prime it was delivered to my doorstep in 2 days.  Great price and my girl loves it (she says it dries her thick hair fast and doesn't dry her hair out in the process), so that's it.  Highly recommend!
This hair dyer works great and I have seen it for more money at local stores. I highly recommend it!
I recently upgraded my old dryer of 8 years.<br />1. This was slightly heavier than I expected, only because my old one was super light weight. However, the weight is not noticeable other than that. The material of the dryer is pleasant to hold.<br />2. Cute design with two optional add ons is a plus.<br />3. Dries quickly! I can fully dry my thick shoulder length hair in 3-4 minutes.<br />4. Much quieter than my old dryer.<br />5. The only con, is that the buttons sometimes can be pushed when drying the hair because of the way they are positioned on the handle. So, if you do not have a mindful touch while blow drying, you may accidentally switch from high output to low output.
It's a bit heavy and smells faintly of burning something, but overall it's fine. It's not so bad that i want to return it. I just wish it were lighter, I guess!
Great product, have had it for about a month now.  Seems well-made, love the soft coating, plenty of power, cool-touch button works well.  Only one slight negative... the placement of the temp. switch is right where my fingers fall on the handle and I always turn it to medium instead of hot heat, but a minor consideration overall. Got this with an on-line coupon which made it an even better value!
I researched several ionic ceramic hair dryers and ended up with this one and I am in love. I'm glad I didn't spend more because this one gets the job done and you can keep some cash in your pocket. I have thick hair and if I were to let it air dry, it would have this ugly frizzy wave to it. I love that this hair dryer came with a concentrator and diffuser. I use the hair dryer by itself first and just finger through my hair with the setting on high speed and high heat to just get the excess water out and then throw on the concentrator and low dry with my ionic brush. I'm literally amazed at how fast I can dry my hair with this thing and I'm kicking myself for not getting one sooner.
Terrific dryer with all the attachments and features one would ever need. Can be used by a professional, has it all. Does not disappoint!
I love the different settings and the drying capability.  I dries very quickly and is great a creating volume.  It is a little heavy, but worth the weight.
This is probably the best hair dryer I've ever had.  I have really thick, corse hair and haven't generally dried it much in the past because it would take so long.  Then once it was dry I'd have to straighten it because it would be all frizzy.  Not anymore!!!  This thing dries my hair quickly and also leaves it very smooth.  I LOVE it!  Now I dry my hair almost daily since it doesn't take me an hour from start to finish!
This was my second purchase of this dryer. The prior one lasted many years and was still working when I replaced it. The only problem with it was the plastic buttons were cracking and falling off so I glued them and kept using it. I like the new one just as we'll, it's efficient and well made. I do tend to accidentally change the temperature setting when I'm using it simply because of where the buttons are and how I hold the dryer. I recommend this dryer despite that.
I love this dryer. I haven't had any problems with it at all and I've been using it for a few months. I love the diffuser and the concentrator. When my previous ionic dryer died after ten years, I had to use a regular 1875 watt dryer for a few days and IT WAS AWFUL! This dryer is faster and does not cause frizz or flyaway like a regular dryer. I haven't had any issues with it getting too hot or attachments popping off as mentioned in a few other reviews. I also haven't had any issues with the nonslip coating peeling or anything like that but I put the dryer away after each use so it is not out on the counter getting sprayed with perfumes and hairsprays etc. I would definitely purchase this product again and highly recommend it.
makes my hair shinier and it maintains the keratin treatment. it is lighter than the one I had before. it is not small, so that's a disadvantage if you are traveling. but it is powerful. recommend it
I have curly hair and this hair dryer has a cold setting which helps to keep my curls from being frizzy.  My last hair dryer did not have a cold setting but just a freeze type button.  I actually wore out the button so I needed to purchase a new hair dryer.  I like that this dryer does not have a flimsy, lightweight feel. I also love that it is black with pink accents.  I am very glad I purchased this product.
shipped super quick!! the speeds in the dryer are extremely convenient esp love the cooling button has no heat at all unlike many dryers tht even with the cooling button, the air is still sort of warm
This hairdryer works particularly well for my fine hair in that it does not &#34;overcook&#34; it as there are multiple settings to choose from. You can choose from 3 heat settings as well as 3 force settings, and lastly there is a &#34;cool shot of air&#34; setting. All of these options have allowed my frequently highlighted hair to remain somewhat healthy looking as opposed to the blowdryers that use maximum heat all the time. I would definitely recommend.
The entire body of this dryer is a matte, somewhat grippy plastic. Really smart feature.<br /><br />Everything else is fine. Buttons, weight, loudness. No issues at all. It dries hair and doesn't blow out eardrums or melt cartilage.<br /><br />Can't write about the long-term reliability, because I've only had it for a couple of weeks. So far,.
This one taught me the error of my ways.  Power/ drying much better.  Sturdy construction and really nice texture. too - won't slide off the counter.  Very much worth a bit more money to get a quality piece of equipment.
Great look, works perfectly. I don't have any problem with the heavy weight as some users would complain about. However the first time I turned it on I did smell something burning, but it only happended once. I use this hair dryer everytime as I wash my hair, about once a day, so far and I'm happy about the purchase. This is not a quiet hair dryer though, but I don't think it's a big deal since almost all the dryers are noisy anyway.
, but for some reason the way the buttons are everytime i grab the dryer to plug it in ive hit the on button and it always is on when plugged in, beyond that its no big deal, and it dries nice and is cute looking, i love the colors!  also i have pretty long hair and this dries pretty quickly which I LOVE!
This is definitely lighter than my last hair dryer. It is pretty quiet too. I wish the detachable nozzle went on easier & was a little longer. My only complaint is regarding the length of the nozzle. They call it the &#34;concentrator&#34; attachment. When I am styling my bangs or blowing out my hair with a round brush - it makes the dryer too close to my head / hair and it makes styling more difficult.  My last hair dryer's attachment was longer with an air flow vent - to keep the air from blasting you in the head. I guess this will take some getting used to. Other than that - seems to quality. The plus is that it does dry my hair faster and with less noise.
I had my previous Vidal Sassoon hair dryer for a VERY long time.  My own stupidity was actually its undoing. I tried to clean off the grate inside by opening the unit and ended up not putting it back together quite right, burning out the motor. Soooo I had to get another hair dryer.  I decided on this one for the price and ratings for the most part. It is heavier probably because of the ceramic inside. I only use it to quickly dry my short hair after a shower so it works great for that. I probably got more than I need in a hair dryer but it does work for me and it works swell. It is the bees knees! Don't know what that means exactly and I am younger than that saying is....but it is kinda fun saying it anyway.
this is a goo product.  hair dresser recommended and uses one.  not sure how the pearl effect is supposed to sustain itself from the ceramic but oh well.  it does what it's supposed to do and I would recommend this to anyone looking for  a quality hair drier.  it was deliverd quickly and was packaged to arrive safely.
Bought this particular item based on positive reviews from Amazon customers.<br />Gave one to my daughter who thought it was quieter than her old dryer and dried her hair quick.<br />Gave one to my mother who thought it was noisy and a bit heavy, but dried her hair very quick.<br />(My mom is the pickiest person on earth....so take it with a grain of salt).<br />Remington sells matching pink hairbrushes, which makes it really gifty.
This hair dryer is much more quiet than my previous hairdryer, which was an adjustable ionic hairdryer.  It has this interesting grippy material around the outside which is very attractive and comfortable to hold.  It is lightweight and has three temperature and three speed settings. I don't think it gets super hot, which for me since I have fine hair and do not wish to dry it out.  My hair was incredibly soft after using this dryer.
This blow dryer is awesome! Beautiful. The body of the dryer is nice a soft. Nice material used on it. And this dryer works very well. It's just so sleek and fun to use. I would give it 10 stars if I could.
I bought this hair dryer for my girlfriend. She has long thick hair and gets tired of all the maintenance it takes. She has been very happy with this product. It works quickly and doesn't damage her hair.
This is a very nice hair dryer. The fan blows very strong, the heat, and the item is solid.
I was looking for an Ionic drier because of how quick it manages my medium length hair. I wasn't worried about compact or travel.<br /><br />It feels heavy enough to be quality, but not too heavy to use. The settings , although I expected a little more power from the high blower setting - but with the ionic tech it doesn't need to blow harder.<br /><br />The cool blast button doesn't react as quickly as turning the heat setting to low.<br /><br />For function, it's perfectly fine, no complaints with function.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like which is a &#34;feature&#34;, is the soft matte finish.  It's pretty when it's new, but it gets scuffed and smudged with styling products and isn't pretty.  I'm not one to clean my styling appliances so often but this one needs a wipe down more often than not. It's not terrible, but I don't like it, and it wasn't an issue with my former drier.<br /><br />There are so many products out there which are comparable, it's really hard to decide. I'm not 'super excited', but I'm happy.
Pros:  doesn't over-dry hair to a crisp. Love the settings and switch options and easy one-handed access when changing modes. My two hair-stylists bought one because they liked mine so much and the great price.<br /><br />Cons:  My first model broke after 14 months. I only use it 3-4 times a week. The heating element died. My husband is a electrical engineer and took it apart and couldn't fix it. It feels like a waste to throw such a nice blow dryer away, but I liked it enough to by another one of the same model. Just hope it lasts longer.
This dryer was really heavy.<br />It hurts my arm when I drying my long hair.<br />So I am using with dryer stand.<br />The strength and sometimes it sparks.<br />Cheap and cute. That's it!!
I gave it as a Christmas present. It looks pretty nice, but she didn't like it and asked me to exchange it for something else. She liked the look of it, confirmed It is less noisy than normal hair dryers, but simply took longer than normal hair dryer for her long hair.
Initially I really liked this hair dryer.  It worked well and ran quietly, but it suddenly stopped working.  While it worked fine yesterday, when I plugged it in this morning it just wouldn't turn on.  Because I've owned it less than two months, I've requested a replacement through Amazon to give it another a try.
Christmas Present for my wife.<br />I now know more about Hair dryers than I ever hoped to know, but she loves it and that is all that matters. She says it is the best she has ever owned.
I have used this for a couple of weeks now and am very pleased with this hair dryer.  It was not overly expensive and works very well, quickly drying the hair.
It's a hairdrier and it works. The true test is how long it will last... and unfortunately, I won't likely come back and review it in a few years.
i love this blow dryer. it's so quiet and it does an outstanding job. :) my friend had lended me hers and i loved it so i went out and purchase one of my own.
Powerful! A little heavy, but not bad. I can dry my hair in 10 mins, 15 if I want it to look nice. Definitely a great tool.
